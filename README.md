# LEGO Sets Explorer: A Power BI Dashboard

## Overview
This project is a guided initiative from **Maven Analytics**, designed to create an interactive Power BI dashboard that helps LEGO enthusiasts explore and discover LEGO sets based on specific criteria. 

<br>

## Project Objective
The goal of this project is to build a **custom interactive Power BI dashboard** that enables LEGO collectors to:

- Simplify the process of finding the perfect LEGO sets released between 1970 and 2022.
- Filter and narrow down sets based on criteria such as theme group, theme, recommended age range, and retail price.

<br>

## Learning Objectives
Through this project, I aimed to:
1. **Load and transform data** for analysis using Power BI.
2. **Design an intuitive layout** with effective visuals.
3. **Incorporate interactive components** to enhance user experience.

<br>

## Dashboard Preview  
Below is a preview of the Power BI dashboard:

### 1. **Main Page**
The main page provides an overview of all LEGO sets, allowing users to filter and explore data dynamically. Key metrics such as the total number of sets, total pieces, and average retail price are displayed.

### 2. **Decomposition Tree**
The decomposition tree visual enables users to drill down into the data by specific dimensions, such as category, theme group, theme, subtheme, and name, to uncover insights.
